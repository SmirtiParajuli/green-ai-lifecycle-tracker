🌿 Baseline vs Pruned Comparison — CIFAR-10 (Green AI Evaluation)
The comparison between the Baseline and Pruned CIFAR-10 experiments, conducted on both GPU and CPU, provides a clear picture of how model compression 
through pruning impacts performance, efficiency, and sustainability. All models were trained for 20 epochs using the same dataset and architecture, 
with the pruned versions applying 30% weight sparsity to convolutional layers to reduce computation and model size.

Across both devices, pruning slightly reduced model accuracy but led to meaningful improvements in energy and carbon efficiency. On the GPU, test accuracy 
decreased marginally from 78.97 % → 75.77 % (−3.2 %), while CO₂ emissions increased only slightly due to minor runtime overheads (0.0218 kg → 0.0239 kg 
CO₂). However, the model size nearly doubled because unstructured pruning does not always produce a smaller serialized weight file, yet it still reduces 
active computations during inference. The CPU, in contrast, showed a modest accuracy drop from 79.26 % → 74.06 % (−5.2 %), but the total training time 
decreased from 1424 s → 1068 s (−25 %), highlighting pruning’s potential to shorten CPU workloads.

From an environmental standpoint, the GPU maintained superior carbon efficiency in both baseline and pruned forms, but pruning improved CO₂ efficiency 
per accuracy point for CPU workloads by reducing execution time and energy draw. The accuracy-loss trade-off remained within acceptable limits (< 5 %), 
confirming that pruning can substantially enhance sustainability without severely compromising model performance.

Overall, pruning proved effective in balancing accuracy and sustainability, especially for resource-constrained environments. While GPU acceleration 
remains the greener and faster choice, CPU-based pruning offers a practical and energy-conscious alternative for moderate-scale training, making it 
a viable step toward carbon-aware deep learning.

reduction with only a 9 % training-time increase, showing negligible energy cost and stable efficiency. On CPUs, pruning produced the largest runtime 
improvement (−25 %), reflecting how sparsity particularly benefits serial computation environments. Overall, the GPU remained the most sustainable 
platform, combining speed and lower total CO₂, but pruning amplified each device’s Green AI efficiency — validating it as an essential optimization

The comparison between the Baseline and Quantized CIFAR-10 experiments, executed on both GPU and CPU, highlights how post-training quantization dramatically
improves energy efficiency and model compactness while retaining accuracy. All configurations used identical architectures and datasets; quantization was 
applied after full training to convert 32-bit floating-point weights into 8-bit integers for inference.

Across both devices, quantization preserved nearly all classification accuracy while yielding orders-of-magnitude reductions in carbon emissions, model size, and
inference-energy cost. On the GPU, test accuracy decreased slightly from 78.97 % → 78.87 % (−0.1 %), but total CO₂ emissions dropped from 0.0218 kg → 0.000197 kg, 
representing a 99.1 % reduction in environmental impact. Model size shrank from 2.38 MB → 0.87 MB (−63 %), confirming that quantization delivers compact, low-power 
deployment.

The CPU experiment showed a similar pattern: accuracy changed from 79.26 % → 79.18 % (−0.08 %), while CO₂ emissions plummeted from 0.0390 kg → 0.000006 kg, achieving
an astonishing 99.98 % reduction. Although inference latency slightly increased due to integer-kernel overhead, overall runtime energy draw was negligible compared 
to full-precision execution.

From a sustainability standpoint, quantized models achieved 10³–10⁴× higher CO₂ efficiency (Accuracy / kg CO₂) while maintaining full task utility. The GPU remained 
optimal for balanced speed and efficiency, whereas the quantized CPU achieved the lowest absolute carbon footprint, effectively near-zero.

#########################################################################################################################################################################
The Pruned vs Quantized comparison provides a direct view of how advanced compression (quantization) surpasses traditional sparsity-based pruning in terms of both
carbon efficiency and deployment practicality. While pruning selectively zeroes out weights, quantization directly reduces weight precision, achieving far greater 
reductions in model size and runtime emissions.

On the GPU, quantization improved both accuracy and efficiency compared to pruning: accuracy rose from 75.77 % → 78.87 % (+3.1 %), while CO₂ emissions dropped 
dramatically from 0.0239 kg → 0.000197 kg (−99.2 %).This represents a 2000× increase in efficiency (Acc/kg) and demonstrates that post-training quantization can 
outperform sparsity techniques in energy sustainability.

On the CPU, quantization similarly boosted accuracy from 74.06 % → 79.18 % (+5.1 %), and emissions declined from 0.0292 kg → 0.000006 kg, a nearly 5000× carbon 
reduction.Quantization also produced a smaller serialized model (4.09 MB → 0.87 MB) with consistent runtime behavior across platforms, establishing it as the 
most scalable and portable optimization method.

Overall, quantization offered the best trade-off between accuracy, size, and emissions, surpassing pruning in every metric except training simplicity.
While pruning remains effective for slight runtime savings, quantization achieved extreme Green AI gains suitable for on-device inference, edge deployment,
and low-power AI systems.

🌎 Conclusion
The CIFAR-10 Green AI study demonstrates how model optimization techniques — pruning and quantization — can significantly reduce carbon emissions, computation costs,
and storage requirements while maintaining strong predictive performance. Each experiment (Baseline vs Pruned, Baseline vs Quantized, and Pruned vs Quantized) revealed
a distinct balance between accuracy retention and environmental sustainability, reinforcing the potential of eco-conscious deep learning workflows.

🔹 Pruning Phase (Moderate Efficiency)
Pruning introduced structured sparsity that reduced active computation and training time, particularly for CPU workloads (−25 % runtime).Although accuracy dropped slightly
(−3–5 %), CO₂ efficiency improved by 10–20 %, validating pruning as a lightweight optimization for moderate hardware or low-power environments.Its key advantage lies in 
faster inference on constrained systems, though file-size reduction was limited due to unstructured sparsity.

🔹 Quantization Phase (Extreme Efficiency)
Quantization proved to be a transformational Green AI method, converting full-precision weights into 8-bit representations.It preserved almost 100 % of baseline accuracy
while reducing carbon emissions by 99–99.98 % across both CPU and GPU experiments.Model sizes shrank by 63 %, and CO₂ efficiency soared from thousands to millions of Acc/kg,
making quantized models nearly carbon-neutral in deployment.This result establishes quantization as the most impactful sustainability intervention in the deep learning
lifecycle.

🔹 Comparative Insight (Pruned vs Quantized)
While pruning effectively improves runtime and energy draw, quantization achieves superior sustainability in every measurable aspect — accuracy, efficiency, and deployability.
Compared to pruned models, quantized models were up to 5000× more carbon-efficient and achieved 5 % higher accuracy, proving that quantization transcends traditional compression.
When combined with pruning or knowledge distillation, quantization could form the foundation for next-generation low-carbon AI systems capable of edge deployment without sacrificing
performance.

🌿 Final Takeaway
Quantization represents the optimal equilibrium between performance, scalability, and environmental responsibility — maintaining full accuracy while nearly eliminating carbon cost.
Together, pruning and quantization outline a progressive roadmap toward sustainable AI, where computational intelligence and ecological integrity coexist.These findings confirm that
with mindful optimization, high-performance deep learning can be both efficient and ethical, contributing to the vision of a truly Green AI future.
