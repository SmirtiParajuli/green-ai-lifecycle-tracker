##  Overview

**Green AI Lifecycle Tracker** is a research project that demonstrates how model optimization techniques can dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of deep learning systems while maintaining competitive accuracy.

By applying **pruning** and **quantization** to convolutional neural networks, this project achieved:

-  **99.97% reduction in CO₂ emissions**
-  **78.87% accuracy** (only 0.1% below baseline)
-  **63% smaller model size** (2.38 MB → 0.87 MB)
-  **4000× improvement in carbon efficiency**

This work proves that high-performance AI can be environmentally responsible.

##  The Problem

Modern deep learning models require enormous computational resources:

-  Training one large language model emits **as much CO₂ as 5 cars over their lifetime**
-  AI workloads account for a growing share of global energy consumption
-  Cloud computing costs for AI training continue to skyrocket
-  The environmental impact of AI threatens broader climate goals

**The Question:** Can we make AI sustainable without losing performance?

**The Answer:** Yes. Through intelligent model optimization.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Experimental Design

Three optimization strategies were evaluated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (60,000 images, 10 classes):

####  Baseline (Control)
- Standard full-precision (FP32) training
- Reference point for accuracy and emissions
- Trained on both GPU and CPU for comparison

####  Pruning
- **30% weight sparsity** applied to convolutional layers
- Magnitude-based unstructured pruning
- Reduces computational load during inference
- Accuracy trade-off: -3% to -5%

####  Quantization
- **Post-training quantization** (FP32 → INT8)
- Converts weights to 8-bit integers
- Dramatically reduces memory bandwidth and energy
- Minimal accuracy loss: -0.1%

### Evaluation Metrics

-  **Test Accuracy** - Model performance on held-out data
-  **CO₂ Emissions** - Total carbon footprint (tracked with CodeCarbon)
-  **Model Size** - Storage requirements in MB
-  **Carbon Efficiency** - Accuracy per kg CO₂ (higher is better)

### Hardware

- **GPU:** NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU
- **CPU:** Multi-core CPU for baseline comparison
- **Training:** 20 epochs per experiment with consistent hyperparameters
