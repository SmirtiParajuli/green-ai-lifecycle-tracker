# Green AI Lifecycle Tracker

Project skeleton for the Green AI Lifecycle Tracker. This repository tracks energy, carbon and efficiency metrics across model development lifecycle stages (training, pruning, quantization, HPO, and reporting).

Structure created as placeholders. Implementations should be added under `src/` and `optimisation/`.

## Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate it: PowerShell: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run experiments or open the dashboard in `dashboard/app.py`.
